# Introduction

In this article, We will explore how to create an asynchronous API module in Python with [the Riot API](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis). I hope this tutorial to be a great starting point for anyone looking to start developing their own modules for the APIs of their choice.
The API I'll be using today is the Riot API available in the Riot Developer portal. Virtually any League of Legends sites and tools there are depend on or at least take advantage of the API. The project I am part of at work also heavily relied on the API and this Python module had been utilized: [RiotWatcher](https://riot-watcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Well, at least until switching to async became inevitable to reduce the execution time. Unfortunately RiotWatcher doesn't inherently support asynchronous requests. There isn't any public Python packages that has the async support either as of February 2024.
Now,
