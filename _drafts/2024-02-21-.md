# Introduction

In this article, We will explore how to create an asynchronous API package in Python with [the Riot API](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis). I hope this tutorial to be a great starting point for anyone looking to start developing their own Python packages for the APIs of their choice.
The API I'll be using today is the Riot API available in the Riot Developer portal. Virtually any League of Legends sites and tools there are depend on or at least take advantage of the API. The API wrapper I've been using is [RiotWatcher](https://riot-watcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which I believe is by far the easiest to use and has the biggest user base. Unfortunately RiotWatcher doesn't inherently support asynchronous requests. In fact, there aren't any public Python packages that have built-in async support either as of February 2024.
Now,
