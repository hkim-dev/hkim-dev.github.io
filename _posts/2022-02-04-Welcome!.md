I sincerely welcome you to my blog! This space is for my small discoveries. Professionally, I’ve had the privilege to work on a wide variety of stuff, including AWS, CI/CD, UI development, etc. For this reason, I get to discover and learn so much on a daily basis. Every day is humbling and exciting.
