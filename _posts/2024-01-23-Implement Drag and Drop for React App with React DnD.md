# Background

I was quite new to the realm of UI/UX development when I first joined my team. After a fair amount of stumbling and hair-pulling, UI development finally started growing on me. Drag and Drop is one of the early features of the app I got to work on, and in this article, I would like to articulate things I learned along the way.

## Why DnD?

Simply put, like a lot of modern apps do, we need to enable usersâ€™ selection for the app. In the middle, the app contains as many as 100 items in a grid. The user chooses items from the grid and the selected ones appear in a list that saves the userâ€™s choices. The simplified layout of the app would look like the below figure:

*Figure 1. Simplified Layout of React App*

My discretion was that the most intuitive approach here to allow the user to select items was using drag and drop.
In the following section, we'll find out how to actually implement the feature for React apps.

# Implement Drag and Drop with [React DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about)

First and foremost, download the library with the following command:

```bash
npm install react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend
```

The second one allows you to use React DnD with [the HTMP5 drag and drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) under the hood.

The configuration required to use React DnD in the code is pretty much straightforward. It is divided into three parts: **setup of DndProvider, draggable, and droppable**.

## Set up DndProvider

Place `DndProvider` near the top of your app and specify backend as `HTML5Backend`. This is my index.tsx file.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { DndProvider } from 'react-dnd';
import { HTML5Backend } from 'react-dnd-html5-backend';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement
);

root.render(
  <DndProvider backend={HTML5Backend}>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
      </React.StrictMode>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </DndProvider>
);
```

## Set up Draggable Component

Make your component draggable using [the `useDrag()` hook](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/api/use-drag). In my case, itâ€™s each tile(item) rendered in the grid. 

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useDrag } from 'react-dnd';

// interface
import Tile from "../../interfaces/Tile";

// endpoint
import endpoints from "../../endpoints.config";

// context
import { useSelectContext } from "../../contexts/SelectContext";

interface TileProps {
  index: number;
  tile: Tile;
  onDragStart: () => void;
  onDragEnd: () => void;
}

const Tile: React.FC<TileProps> = ({
  index, // item's index in the grid
  tile,
  onDragStart,
  onDragEnd
}) => {
  const [isDropped, setIsDropped] = useState(false);

  const [{ isDragging }, drag] = useDrag(() => ({
    type: 'tile',
    item: { type: 'tile', tile: tile }, // the item passed in to the tile
    canDrag: !isDropped, // enable dragging only if the tile is not dropped
    collect: monitor => ({
      isDragging: !!monitor.isDragging(),
    }),
    end: (item, monitor) => {
      // reference: https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/api/drop-target-monitor
      const didDrop = monitor.didDrop();
      if (didDrop) {
        setIsDropped(true);
      };
      onDragEnd(); // notify the parent component when dragging ends
    }
  }));

  return (
    <div
      ref={drag}
      id={`tile-${index}`}
      key={index}
      className={`transform hover:scale-110 transition-transform duration-300 // increase the size on hover
        ${isDragging
          ? 'opacity-50 shadow-lg cursor-grabbing ease-in-out'
          : 'opacity-100 cursor-pointer ease-in-out'}
        ${isDropped
          ? 'grayscale pointer-events-none'
          : 'pointer-events-auto'}
      `}
      onMouseDown={onDragStart} // notify the parent component when dragging starts
    >
      <img
        className="mx-auto rounded-lg cursor-pointer filter"
        src={`${endpoints.IMG_URL}${tile.image}`}
        alt={`${tile.image}`}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Tile;
```

The parts worth highlighting here are as follows:

- Customize visual effects while the user is dragging an object - use the `isDragging` hook for this.
- Use `monitor.didDrop()` to be informed of when a drop has finished. `end` is called when the dragging stops, so make sure to update any state variables if you have any in the `end` object. In my code, `isDropped` is maintained to track the availability of each tile.

## Set up Droppable Component

Fianlly, the component to be filled with draggable components. This is the Pick component, which is basically a drop zone.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { MdCancel } from "react-icons/md";
import { useDrop } from 'react-dnd';

// interfaces
import { TileList } from "../../interfaces/TileList";

interface PickProps {
  tileList: TileList;
  setTileList: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<TileList>>;
  index: number;
};

const Pick: React.FC<PickProps> = ({
  tileList,
  setTileList,
  index,
}) => {
  const [isHovered, setHovered] = useState(false);
  const [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  // handle functions for mouse entering and leaving
  const handleMouseEnter = () => {
    setHovered(true);
  };
  const handleMouseLeave = () => {
    setHovered(false);
  };

  // function to handle remove button click
  //  - makes the selected tile disappear from the lists when clicked
  //  - makes the tile draggable again
  const handleRemoveClick = () => {
    setTileList((prevTileList) => ({
      ...prevTileList,
      [index]: null,
    }));
  };

  // DnD - drop configuration
  // reference: https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/api/use-drop
  const [{ isOver }, drop] = useDrop({
    accept: 'tile',
    drop: (item: any) => {
      // force re-render after updating the list
      setTileList((prevTileList) => ({
        ...prevTileList,
        [index]: item['tile'],
      }));
    },
    canDrop: () => {
      // logic removed
    },
    collect: (monitor) => ({
      isOver: !!monitor.isOver(),
    })
  });

    // logic for getting image value removed
  const backgroundStyle: React.CSSProperties = {
    backgroundImage: image
      ? `url(${IMG_URL}/${image})`
      : 'none',
  };

  return (
    <div
      className={`bg-[#292c33] aspect-square rounded-lg outline-dashed overflow-hidden ${
        isOver ? 'outline-blue-500' : 'outline-[#444a4f]'
      } relative`}
      onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}
      onMouseLeave={handleMouseLeave}
      style={backgroundStyle}
      ref={drop}
    >
      {tileList[index] && isHovered && (
        <button
          className={
            `text-white opacity-0 hover:opacity-70 top-1/2 left-1/2 h-full w-full
            transform -translate-x-1/2 transition-opacity -translate-y-1/2 relative rounded-full 
            p-1 delay-75 duration-300 ease-in-out`
          }
          onClick={handleRemoveClick}
        >
          <MdCancel className="w-full h-full" />
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Pick;
```

Hoping the logic that I needed for the user to undo selections do not confuse you, Iâ€™d like to point out several things here:

- Specify accepted type(s) in `useDrop` like I did if there are multiple draggable types in your app. Itâ€™s out of this articleâ€™s scope so the final code was excluded from the above code snippet. I also had to make droppable objects draggable so that users can exchange locations of selected items. If youâ€™re in need of multiple draggable objects, pass an array of types to accept. e.g, `accept: ['item1', 'item2']`
- Using `canDrop`, you can control when it should accept a drop or not. Return `false` or `true` based on your requirements.

# Closing Thoughts

Navigating UI/UX territory as a newbie brought its fair share of challenges, especially when tasked with adding a Drag and Drop (DnD) feature to our React app. Choosing [React DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about) made the process smoother and more in tune with our app's needs.

For me, the project wasnâ€™t just about features; it laid the groundwork for understanding user-friendly design. Here's to the UI/UX journey - where every click is a step toward better interfaces! ðŸš€
